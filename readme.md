# Exercism Solutions: TypeScript, Go, JavaScript

## About the Project

This repository contains my solutions for exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org), focusing on three programming languages: TypeScript, Go, and JavaScript. This is part of my educational journey in learning and enhancing my programming skills.

## Technologies

- TypeScript
- Go
- JavaScript

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into three main directories, each corresponding to one of the programming languages:

- `typescript/` - contains solutions for TypeScript exercises
- `go/` - contains solutions for Go exercises
- `javascript/` - contains solutions for JavaScript exercises

## How to Use

Each folder contains a series of exercises. Within each folder, the exercises are organized according to the exercise names on Exercism. To run a solution, navigate to the appropriate directory and follow the instructions in the comments within the source files.

## How to Test

Instructions for running tests for each exercise are included in each language-specific directory.

## Contributions and Suggestions

I welcome suggestions and contributions to improve my programming skills. If you have any feedback, feel free to create an issue or a pull request.
